However, consulting the class notes, and web pages that explain the material taught in class but do NOT show a solution to the homework problem in question are permissible to view.  Clearly, there's a fuzzy line here between a valid use of resources and cheating. To avoid this line, one should merely consult the course notes, the course textbook, and references that contain syntax and/or formulas.\n",

    "1.1) Scientists are misusing p-values in one of four ways I could make out in the article: \n",
    "\n",
    "1: They sometimes treat it as \"the probability of your hypothesis given your data\" when it is supposed to be the other way around.\n",
    "\n",
    "2: Sometimes the researchers goals can shift \"from seeking the truth to obtaining a p-value that clears an arbitrary threshold\" which can end up not having any statistical significance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3: Researchers also somtimes fail to adjust their p-values for \"cherry picking, multiple testing, post-data subgroups and other biasing selection effects\".\n",
    "\n",
    "4: P-values are somtimes \"treated as a way to sort results into bins labeled significant or not significant\" by scientists which is also a misuse of them accoring to the article.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.2) In the article, the author suggests that the p-value should be used to tell you something about the \"probability of seeing your results given a particular hypothetical explanation\" meaning, they are used to test a claim about a hypothetical situation based on results from an experiment. \n",
    "\n",
    "1.3) To find how many tests it will take before we there is a 50% chance we incorrectly reject the null hypothesis we need to know the probability we will incorrectly reject the hypothesis. Since there is a 95% chance we don't reject the null hypothesis for a single test, the probability we will incorreclty reject the null is $1 - (0.95)^n$ where n is the number of tests we will run. So what we need to do is set this equal to $0.5$ to find how many tests (n) we need for the chance to be 50% exactly. \n",
    "\n",
    "$1 - 0.95^n = 0.5 \\implies 1 - 0.5 = 0.95^n \\implies \\ln(0.5) = \\ln(0.95^n) = \\ln(0.5) = n \\cdot ln(0.95) \\implies n = \\dfrac{\\ln(0.5)}{\\ln(0.95)} = 13.5$\n",

    "\n",
    "1.4) The Bonferroni correction says to divide the 0.05 cutoff to rejec the null hypothesis needs to be corrected when testing for multiple different circumstances to have some kind of relation to the hypothesis we are testing. One way we could use it from the jelly bean example would be to correct their example experiment to see if the different colors of jelly beans have different affects on acne. Since there are 20 different colors of jelly beans, we would use the Bonferroni correction by dividing the 0.05 cutoff by 20. This value is the percent of tests that would have to oppose the null in order to us to reject it."

    "## Question 4: Deflategate\n",
    "\n",
    "On January 18, 2015, the Indianapolis Colts and the New England Patriots played the American Football Conference (AFC) championship game to determine which of those teams would play in the Super Bowl. After the game, there were allegations that the Patriots' footballs had not been inflated as much as the regulations required; they were softer. This could be an advantage, as softer balls might be easier to catch.\n",
    "\n",
    "For several weeks, the world of American football was consumed by accusations, denials, theories, and suspicions: the press labeled the topic Deflategate, after the Watergate political scandal of the 1970's. The National Football League (NFL) commissioned an independent analysis. In this example, we will perform our own analysis of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pressure is often measured in pounds per square inch (psi). NFL rules stipulate that game balls must be inflated to have pressures in the range 12.5 psi and 13.5 psi. Each team plays with 12 balls. Teams have the responsibility of maintaining the pressure in their own footballs, but game officials inspect the balls. Before the start of the AFC game, all the Patriots' balls were at about 12.5 psi. Most of the Colts' balls were at about 13.0 psi. However, these pre-game data were not recorded.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the second quarter, the Colts intercepted a Patriots ball. On the sidelines, they measured the pressure of the ball and determined that it was below the 12.5 psi threshold. Promptly, they informed officials. \n",
    "\n",
    "At half-time, all the game balls were collected for inspection. Two officials, Clete Blakeman and Dyrol Prioleau, measured the pressure in each of the balls. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the data. Each row corresponds to one football. Pressure is measured in psi. The Patriots ball that had been intercepted by the Colts was not inspected at half-time. Nor were most of the Colts' balls – the officials simply ran out of time and had to relinquish the balls for the start of second half play."

    "“The average pressure drop of the Patriots game balls exceeded the average pressure drop of the Colts balls by 0.45 to 1.02 psi, depending on various possible assumptions regarding the gauges used, and assuming an initial pressure of 12.5 psi for the Patriots balls and 13.0 for the Colts balls.”  (Investigative report commissioned by the NFL regarding the AFC Championship game on January 18, 2015)\n",
